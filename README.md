# troposphere
The program allows a user to determine the accurate fee to be paid based on the JSON provided.

To run the program user needs to clone the repository in local. This link can be used to clone the project: https://github.com/cooolfool/troposphere.git. Once cloned this can be imported in IDE as a MAVEN project.

Before running the application,check for the directory for the JSON document and update it with the location it is present in your system(Line no 23 in App.java).

once these steps are done, run the App.java file as java application.

The user is asked to enter the option for the Fee type and further steps are printed in console.

Thank you.
